## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

The project is Ochi design, which is designing company, I made a landing page of it with a help of Shreyian coding collage youtube video.
but they make it on react.js and tailwind css and I use Scss to inchancing raw skill and use some tailwind too where i got stuck


# Learning 


Learned how to implement LOCOMOTIVE SCROLL BETA in next.js. Next js is server side rendering so they don't have window object which mean we cannot use window object inside it. so without window object we cannot use locomotive scroll so I serached on google and I implement in easy way

2.In this video some conditional rendring and optimization of css code and components


```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
